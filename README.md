A Javascript interface for FYERS API.<br>
üì¶ [Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extra-fyers),
üåê [Web](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extra-fyers.web),
üìú [Files](https://unpkg.com/extra-fyers/),
üì∞ [Docs](https://nodef.github.io/extra-fyers/).

The objective of this package is to provide a cleaner interface to [FYERS API].
The `http` namespace provides the same interface as FYERS HTTP API. The
`websocket` namespace provides the same interface as FYERS WebSocket API, along
with parsing of binary market data. This allows you to recieve *instant*
notifications of *order update* and *market data*. The top namespace (global
functions, classes) provide a [facade] for the HTTP and the WebSocket APIs and
provides additional utility functions, such as calculating charges.

Global functions associated with FYERS API, such as `getPositions()`, are
stateless and accept `Authorization` as the first parameter. On the other
hand, the `Api` class includes stateful functions which do not require
the `Authorization` parameter (required while creating object). Note that
this authorization can be obtained be performing login with `loginStep1()`
and `loginStep2()`.

The goals for the future include doing a thorough interface check, and possibly
writing a CLI interface. Obtaining details of symbols, including images and more
could be done as part of a separate package.

This package is available in both *Node.js* and *Web* formats. The web format
is exposed as `extra_fyers` standalone variable and can be loaded from
[jsDelivr CDN].

```javascript
const fyers = require('extra-fyers');

async function main() {
  var appId       = '****';  // app_id recieved after creating app
  var accessToken = '****';  // access_token recieved after login
  var api = new fyers.Api(appId, accessToken);

  // List equity and commodity fund limits.
  console.log(await api.getFunds());

  // List holdings.
  console.log(await api.getHoldings());

  // Place CNC market order for SBIN (equity) on NSE for 5 shares
  var id = await api.placeOrder({symbol: 'NSE:SBIN-EQ', quantity: 5});

  // List postions for today (should list NSE:SBIN-EQ-CNC).
  console.log(await api.getPositions());
}
main();
```
